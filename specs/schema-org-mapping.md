# Mapping AI Agent Ontology to Schema.org

This document outlines the proposed mapping and extension points for integrating the AI Agent Ontology with Schema.org. The goal is to leverage existing Schema.org vocabulary where appropriate and propose extensions for concepts unique to autonomous agent communication, delegation, and verifiable execution.

## Core Principles for Mapping

1.  **Leverage Existing Vocabulary:** Prioritize using existing Schema.org types and properties whenever a direct or close semantic match is found.
2.  **Extend When Necessary:** Propose new types or properties only when the AI Agent Ontology introduces novel concepts that cannot be adequately represented by existing Schema.org vocabulary.
3.  **Maintain Interoperability:** Ensure that proposed extensions are designed to be compatible with the broader Schema.org ecosystem and principles.

## Proposed Mappings and Extensions

Below is a table detailing the mapping of key AI Agent Ontology concepts to Schema.org. For concepts where a direct mapping is insufficient, a rationale for extension is provided.

| AI Agent Ontology Concept (Prefix: `core`, `del`, `acc`, `cap`, `id`, `int`) | Closest Schema.org Type/Property | Rationale / Proposed Extension |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| **`core:Agent`** (Class)                                          | `schema:Thing`, `schema:Person`, `schema:Organization` | `core:Agent` represents an autonomous actor, which can be a `schema:Person` (e.g., a human-controlled agent), `schema:Organization` (e.g., a corporate bot), or a more abstract `schema:Thing`. We propose `core:Agent` as a new type, potentially a subclass of `schema:Thing`, to specifically denote an autonomous, capable, and accountable entity in a semantic environment. It would carry properties like `hasCapability`, `hasIntent`, `executesAction`. |
| **`core:Capability`** (Class)                                     | `schema:Action`, `schema:Service` | `core:Capability` describes what an agent *can do*. While `schema:Action` describes *what happened* or *what can be done*, `core:Capability` is a more abstract description of a functional competence. It could be seen as a `schema:Service` or a new type `core:Capability` that describes a specific skill or function an agent possesses, potentially linking to `schema:Action` types it can perform. |
| **`core:Delegation`** (Class)                                     | `schema:AuthorizeAction`, `schema:Grant` | `core:Delegation` is a structured semantic relation where one Agent authorizes another. `schema:AuthorizeAction` is a good starting point. We propose `core:Delegation` as a more specific type, potentially a subclass of `schema:AuthorizeAction`, to capture the specific properties of agent delegation: `delegatedBy`, `delegatesTo`, `delegationScope`. |
| **`core:Intent`** (Class)                                         | `schema:Action`, `schema:Purpose` | `core:Intent` is a semantic expression of purpose or objective. While `schema:Action` has an `actionStatus` and `purpose`, `core:Intent` is a distinct concept representing the *desired outcome* or *goal* that drives an agent's actions. We propose `core:Intent` as a new type, potentially linked to `schema:Action` via a property like `action:hasIntent`. |
| **`core:Action`** (Class)                                         | `schema:Action`                  | `core:Action` is a concrete execution event. This maps very well to `schema:Action`. We would extend `schema:Action` with properties like `producesArtifact` and `recordedIn` to link to verifiable execution records and outputs specific to agent interactions. |
| **`core:Artifact`** (Class)                                       | `schema:CreativeWork`, `schema:Thing` | `core:Artifact` is a produced output or result. This can map to `schema:CreativeWork` (for digital content) or a more general `schema:Thing`. We propose `core:Artifact` as a new type, potentially a subclass of `schema:CreativeWork`, to specifically denote outputs generated by agent execution, with properties like `type` (MIME type) and `content` (data). |
| **`acc:TraceEvent`** (Class)                                      | `schema:Event`, `schema:Action`  | `acc:TraceEvent` is a verifiable record of an action. This could be a specialized `schema:Event` or a new type `acc:TraceEvent` that explicitly links to the `core:Action` it records, the `core:Agent` that performed it, and includes cryptographic proofs or hashes for verifiability. |
| **`id:Identity`** (Class)                                         | `schema:Thing`, `schema:Identifier` | `id:Identity` represents the verifiable identity of an agent. This is a foundational concept. We propose `id:Identity` as a new type, potentially a subclass of `schema:Identifier`, to encapsulate verifiable credentials, DIDs, and other cryptographic identity mechanisms. |
| **`core:hasCapability`** (Property)                               | `schema:hasOffer`, `schema:knowsAbout` | This property links an `Agent` to a `Capability`. It could be seen as a specialized `schema:knowsAbout` or `schema:hasOffer` (if the capability is offered as a service). We propose `core:hasCapability` as a new property for `core:Agent` to explicitly state its functional competences. |
| **`core:delegatedBy`** (Property)                                 | `schema:agent`, `schema:provider` | For `core:Delegation`, `delegatedBy` indicates the granting agent. This is similar to `schema:agent` or `schema:provider` in the context of an `AuthorizeAction`. We propose `core:delegatedBy` as a specific property for `core:Delegation`. |
| **`core:delegatesTo`** (Property)                                 | `schema:recipient`, `schema:agent` | For `core:Delegation`, `delegatesTo` indicates the receiving agent. Similar to `schema:recipient` or `schema:agent`. We propose `core:delegatesTo` as a specific property for `core:Delegation`. |
| **`core:delegationScope`** (Property)                             | `schema:scope`                   | Specifies the scope of allowed capabilities within a Delegation. We propose `core:delegationScope` as a new property for `core:Delegation`, with a range of `core:Capability` or a list of specific actions. |
| **`core:executesAction`** (Property)                              | `schema:performs`                | Links an `Agent` to an `Action` it performs. This is a direct and crucial link. We propose `core:executesAction` as a new property for `core:Agent` to explicitly state the actions it has performed. |
| **`core:producesArtifact`** (Property)                            | `schema:result`, `schema:output` | Links an `Action` to an `Artifact` it produces. This is similar to `schema:result` or `schema:output` for `schema:Action`. We propose `core:producesArtifact` as a new property for `core:Action`. |
| **`core:recordedIn`** (Property)                                  | `schema:recordedAt`              | Links an `Action` to its `TraceEvent`. We propose `core:recordedIn` as a new property for `core:Action` to link to the verifiable trace record. |

## Next Steps for Schema.org Proposal
