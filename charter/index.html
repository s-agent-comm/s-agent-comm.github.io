    <h1>[DRAFT] Semantic Agent Communication Community Group Charter</h1>

    <p>This Charter is work in progress. To submit feedback, please use the group’s GitHub Issues page.</p>

      <li>This Charter: https://www.w3.org/community/s-agent-comm/charter/</li>
      <li>Previous Charter: None (initial charter)</li>

    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
    <p>
      The Semantic Agent Communication Community Group aims to define semantic models and communication structures
      that enable autonomous software agents to interoperate in a verifiable, accountable, and machine-interpretable manner.
      Existing approaches focus on transport protocols or model-level behaviors. This group focuses instead on 
      the semantic layer required for identity, delegation, capability discovery, intent modeling, and execution traceability.
      The goal is to establish a common semantic foundation for interoperable agent-to-agent communication across
      heterogeneous systems, identity frameworks, and governance requirements.
    </p>

    <h2 id="scope-of-work">Scope of Work</h2>
    <p>
      The Community Group will define the semantic structures required for agent-to-agent communication. 
      These structures describe how identity, delegation, capabilities, intent, and execution evidence 
      are represented and interpreted across heterogeneous agent systems.  
      The scope includes conceptual, logical, and machine-interpretable models that support:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interaction Semantics</strong>: Core definitions for Intent, Delegation, Capability advertisement, 
      ExecutionRecord, and other CommunicativeActs used in interoperable agent communication.</li>

      <li><strong>Identity and Verifiability Primitives</strong>: Conceptual models drawing on technologies such as 
      Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), signatures, and provenance structures 
      to establish trust in agent actions, including bindings to hardware attestation mechanisms.</li>

      <li><strong>Narrative Model</strong>: The abstract model for append-only, context-complete semantic logs 
      that enable traceability, accountability, and explainability of agent behavior.</li>

      <li><strong>Semantic Ledger Model</strong>: A logical, implementation-agnostic model for ordered, immutable, 
      verifiable records. No specific blockchain or distributed system architecture is implied.</li>

      <li><strong>Conformance Definitions</strong>: Minimal normative requirements for interpreting 
      semantic structures (e.g., CommunicativeActs, Delegations) consistently across implementations.</li>

      <li><strong>Schema.org Extension Exploration</strong>: Identifying and preparing candidate extensions to 
      Schema.org for Agent-related concepts to support broader discoverability and Web interoperability.</li>

      <li><strong>Knowledge Representation Integration</strong>: Conceptual modeling of how stateful, 
      version-controlled knowledge representation technologies can interface with agent communication semantics. 
      Stateless systems such as vector databases are considered insufficient for these semantic requirements 
      and remain outside the group’s technical definition.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The CG may maintain multiple GitHub repositories under a shared organization. 
      All repositories operate under this Charter, the CLA, and the same contribution rules.
    </p>

    <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
    <p>
      To ensure clarity of scope, the following topics are explicitly out of scope:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Transport Protocols</strong>: No definition or extension of HTTP, WebSockets, TCP, UDP, or QUIC.</li>
      <li><strong>Internal Agent Reasoning</strong>: No specification of LLMs, planners, inference engines, or cognitive architectures.</li>
      <li><strong>Execution Backends</strong>: No requirements for CPU, GPU, WASM, or other hardware execution models.</li>
      <li><strong>Distributed Ledger Technology</strong>: No consensus protocols or blockchain definitions.</li>
      <li><strong>Domain-Specific Ontologies</strong>: No legal, medical, or vertical knowledge models.</li>
      <li><strong>Runtime Implementations</strong>: The CG does not define SDKs, operational agents, or execution runtimes.</li>
      <li><strong>Regulatory Interpretation</strong>: The CG does not define legal norms or policy directives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

    <h3 id="specifications">Specifications</h3>
    <p>

      and machine-readable artifacts including:
    </p>

      Vocabulary files defining agent identity, capabilities, delegation, intent, and execution semantics.</li>

      <li><strong>SHACL Shapes for Ontology Validation</strong>: 
      Shapes that support conformance and data quality checks.</li>

      <li><strong>AgentIDL Specification</strong>: 
      A non-normative description of an interface description language derived from the ontology 
      to facilitate code generation. A reference implementation MAY be produced.</li>

      <li><strong>Interoperability and Governance Notes</strong>: 
      Guidelines for implementers, operators, and system designers adopting the semantic models.</li>

      <li><strong>Best Practices</strong>: 
      Documentation on integrating the semantic layer with agent runtimes, identity frameworks, 
      provenance systems, and OS-level mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="non-normative-reports">Non-Normative Reports</h3>
    <p>
      The group may produce additional Community Group Reports such as use cases, requirements, 
      white papers, interoperability guides, and mapping documents.

      Terms in this Charter that conflict with that Process are void.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Community Group does not produce W3C normative standards. 
      All reports are non-normative unless transitioned into a W3C Working Group.
    </p>

    <p>
      W3C seeks organizational commitments under the 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/">Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
      When an individual contributes without representing an organization, W3C will seek a CLA from the relevant 
      organization when the individual makes a contribution to a Deliverable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>
      applies to participation in this group.
    </p>

    <h2 id="worklimit">Work Limited to Charter Scope</h2>
    <p>
      The group will not publish Specifications outside the defined scope. 
      See <a href="#charter-change">Amendments to this Charter</a> for revision procedures.
    </p>

    <h2 id="contrib">Contribution Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
      Substantive contributions to Deliverables may only be made by participants who have agreed 
      to the W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
    </p>

    <p>
      All outputs must use the 
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      All contributions occur in the group’s GitHub repositories, via pull requests, issues, 
      or comments on existing issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      All repositories must include the standard 
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a>

      Meeting minutes and summaries will be posted publicly.
    </p>

    <h2 id="decision">Decision Process</h2>
    <p>
      The group will seek consensus. If consensus is unclear, a Call for Consensus (CfC) may be issued.
      When required for progress, Committers may select an alternative with substantial support.
      Objections may be addressed by maintaining alternative forks for evaluation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="chairs">Chair Selection</h2>
    <p>
      Participants choose their Chair(s). If five participants from distinct organizations call for an election,
      the group will conduct a formal election as described in the charter template, 
      consulting the Community Development Lead as necessary.
    </p>

    <h2 id="charter-change">Amendments to this Charter</h2>
    <p>
      The group may propose an amended charter using the Decision Process. 
      Approval requires a 30-day vote and 2/3 support of votes cast.
